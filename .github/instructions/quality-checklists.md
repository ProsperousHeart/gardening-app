## 💻 Code Generation (TDD) Stage Quality Checklist

### TDD Compliance

#### RED Phase

- ✅ Test written BEFORE implementation code
- ✅ Test clearly defines expected behavior
- ✅ Test fails for the right reason
- ✅ Test follows naming convention: `test_{behavior}_description`

#### GREEN Phase

- ✅ Minimal code written to pass test
- ✅ Test now passes
- ✅ No over-engineering

#### REFACTOR Phase

- ✅ Code improved while tests stay green
- ✅ Duplication removed
- ✅ Readability enhanced
- ✅ Naming improved

### Test Quality

- ✅ Unit tests cover all functions/methods
- ✅ Integration tests cover component interactions
- ✅ Edge cases tested
- ✅ Error conditions tested
- ✅ Security scenarios tested (for sensitive code)
- ✅ Test coverage ≥ 90%
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ No skipped tests without justification

### Test Structure

- ✅ Test directory mirrors `src/` structure
- ✅ Test files named `test_{module_name}.py`
- ✅ Tests use AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- ✅ Tests are independent (no shared state)
- ✅ Tests are repeatable

### Code Quality

- ✅ Ruff checks pass (linting)
- ✅ Ruff format applied
- ✅ No TODO comments without tracking issue
- ✅ No commented-out code

## 🔄 Using These Checklists

### For Human Reviewers

1. Copy relevant checklist to review notes
2. Check each box as you verify
3. Document any issues found
4. Request changes if DoD not met
5. Approve when all boxes checked

### For AI Assistants

When conducting reviews, reference this file:

```
Conduct {stage} quality review following quality-checklists.md
```

AI should:

- Verify each checklist item
- Report which items pass/fail
- Suggest fixes for failures
- Update execution log with results

### Example Output

```markdown
## Requirements Stage Quality Review

### Completeness

- ✅ Problem statement clearly defined
- ✅ Target users/stakeholders identified
- ❌ Success criteria not measurable (ISSUE: criteria too vague)
- ✅ Acceptance criteria specific and testable
  ...

**Result**: ❌ Failed - 1 issue found
**Action Needed**: Clarify success criteria with measurable metrics
```
